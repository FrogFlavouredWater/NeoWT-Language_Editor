# NeoWT — War Thunder Localization Editor

NeoWT is a friendly desktop app for Windows that lets you **search, edit, and manage War Thunder’s localization CSV files**. It includes fuzzy search, fast in‑place editing with undo, and **profiles** so your tweaks survive game updates.

**Download for Windows:**\
👉 [NeoWT‑Setup‑1.3.0‑x64.exe](https://github.com/FrogFlavouredWater/NeoWT-Language_Editor/releases/download/Release/NeoWT-Setup-1.3.0-x64.exe)

> NeoWT edits **text only** (client‑side). It doesn’t touch gameplay and won’t give you an advantage.

## Features

- **Fuzzy search** across keys and values (find strings even if you don’t know the exact phrasing)
- **Inline edit & undo** (per‑row undo + global *Undo last change*)
- **Profiles**: save your edits and re‑apply them after a game update
- **Utilities**
  - Delete/refresh the game’s `lang` folder (so WT recreates fresh language files)
  - Save / Apply / Delete profiles
  - Launch War Thunder (Steam by default; native launcher optional)
- Clean, modern dark theme that mirrors the app

---

## Quick Start

1. **Install** NeoWT (download link above) and launch it.
2. On first run, set your **War Thunder root folder**:
   - Click **Browse** or **Auto‑locate**. (On Steam, it’s usually under `Steam/steamapps/common/War Thunder`.)
   - You can also open Steam → Library → War Thunder → **⚙️ Manage → Browse local files** to find it.
3. **If you don’t see a **``** folder yet**
   - Launch War Thunder once and/or enable custom localization. One common way is adding the following to your `config.blk` (inside the `debug{}` block), then launching the game once so it generates the folder:
     ```blk
     debug{
       // …other settings…
       testLocalization:b=yes
     }
     ```
   - After `lang` appears next to the game executable, close the game and return to NeoWT.
4. In NeoWT, pick a **CSV** (e.g. `menu.csv`) and a **language column** (e.g. `English`).
5. Use the search bar, click the pink **✎** next to a result to edit, then **Save**.

## Using Profiles

**Profiles** are snapshots of your edits (stored as JSON). They make it easy to recover your changes after updates.

- **Save Profile** → Create a named snapshot of all current edits.
- **Apply Profile** → Replay those edits into the latest CSVs.
- **Delete Profile** → Remove a snapshot you no longer need.
- **After a WT update**: The game may refresh the CSVs. Use NeoWT → **Utilities → Delete **`` (clears old files and your recent‑changes log). Launch WT once to regenerate `lang`, then **Apply Profile** to bring back your customizations.

> Tip: *Apply Profile* repopulates **Recent changes** so you can see exactly what was applied (and undo individual items if needed).

## Where Are the Files?

Typical locations (your drive may differ):

- **Steam (Windows):** `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\War Thunder\lang\`
- **Steam (Linux):** `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/War Thunder/lang/`
- **Steam (macOS):** `/Applications/War Thunder.app/Contents/Resources/game/lang/`

If you can’t find it, in Steam: **Manage → Browse local files**, then look for the `` folder next to `aces.exe` / `launcher.exe`.

---

## Troubleshooting

**No **``** folder**

- Launch War Thunder once and/or add `testLocalization:b=yes` to `config.blk` (see *Quick Start*). The folder is generated by the game.

**Text didn’t change in game**

- Ensure you edited the correct **language column** (e.g., `English`) and **key**. Restart the game after saving.

**After an update, my edits are gone**

- Expected—updates refresh `lang`. In NeoWT → **Delete **`` → start WT once (regenerates files) → **Apply Profile**.

**Odd characters / encoding issues**

- NeoWT writes UTF‑8 CSV with the original headers. If a CSV is malformed (strange quoting/semicolons), re‑open the file. If it persists, back up the original and verify in a plain text editor.

**Launch button does nothing**

- Set your WT root folder in NeoWT. By default we launch via Steam (AppID 236390). Toggle to the native launcher in **Utilities** if you don’t use Steam.

## Install & Updates

### Windows (installer)

1. Download **NeoWT‑Setup‑1.3.0‑x64.exe** from Releases.
2. Run the installer. Windows SmartScreen may warn about an unknown publisher—click **More info → Run anyway** (until we ship signed builds. This is a limitation of not paying exorbitant fees to Microsoft).
3. Start NeoWT from the Start menu.

### Data locations

- **Config**: stored in your OS *user data* folder when packaged (e.g., `%APPDATA%/NeoWT/config.json`).
- **Profiles & changes log**: `%APPDATA%/NeoWT/res/` (Windows) or the equivalent on macOS/Linux.

> In development, config also lives at `src/res/config/config.json` for convenience.

## Build From Source (Developers)

```bash
# 1) Install dependencies
npm i

# 2) Run in dev
npm run dev

# 3) Package (Windows)
npm run dist:nsis      # installer
npm run dist:portable  # portable exe
```

**Notes**

- We use `electron-builder`. Installer and portable artifacts go to `dist/`.
- If Windows complains about symlink privileges during build, enable **Developer Mode** or run the build in an elevated shell.

## FAQ

**Is this allowed?**\
Editing localization **text** is a client‑side customization. Keep it to text; don’t redistribute game files. Share your **profiles** (which contain only your changes) instead.

**Does this work without Steam?**\
Yes. NeoWT can launch WT via Steam (default) or a native launcher. We try to auto‑detect based on your chosen root path.

**macOS/Linux support?**\
The UI works, but we currently only ship a Windows installer. You can build from source on macOS/Linux if you’re comfortable with Node/Electron.

**Where are profiles stored? Can I back them up?**\
Profiles are JSON files under the app’s user data folder (see *Data locations*). You can back them up or share them.

**Will this survive updates?**\
Yes—use **profiles**. After an update, refresh `lang`, then apply your profile to replay your edits.
